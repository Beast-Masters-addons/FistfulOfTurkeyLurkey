# Fistful of Turkey Lurkey
FistfulOfTurkey

A helper addon for WoW achievements based on targeting different races and classes with an item:
If the targeted or mouse-over player is not completed, the add-on will show a notification frame telling the players
level and race. The notification will not be shown if the player level is too low to give credit for the achievement.

Some achievements have a limit for how often a player can be affected by the item, if the player has an active buff from
a previous hit the notification will include the remaining time of the buff.
